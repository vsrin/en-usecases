    keyQuestion: 'What if actuaries could test every plausible cohort hypothesis .  not just the ones time allows?',
    summary:
      'Traditional cohort analysis tests a fraction of possible segmentations due to manual constraints. This use case explores how composable AI agents can systematically evaluate cohort hypotheses while preserving actuarial rigor, governance, and regulatory transparency.',

    keyQuestion: 'What if Fast NOs were as fast as Fast YESes. and both happened in minutes?',
    summary:
      'Commercial underwriters spend 3-29 days on submissions that never convert, while prospects wait. This use case explores how agentic AI enables instant appetite alignment checks, automated technical ratings for in-appetite risks, and immediate Fast NOs for out-of-appetite submissions .  shifting underwriter time from screening to strategic decision-making.',

    keyQuestion: 'How much risk insight is trapped in loss run PDFs that no one has time to properly decode?',
    summary:
      'Loss runs are the most information-dense artifact in commercial underwriting .  yet they arrive in dozens of formats and are typically reviewed through pattern recognition rather than systematic extraction. This use case explores what changes when AI agents normalize and interrogate loss history at scale.',

    keyQuestion: 'What if compliance were a property of the workflow, not a review that happens after?',
    summary:
      'Insurance compliance traditionally operates as a retrospective check. This use case explores the architectural shift toward embedding governance agents directly within operational workflows .  making compliance continuous, auditable, and inseparable from the decisions themselves.',
